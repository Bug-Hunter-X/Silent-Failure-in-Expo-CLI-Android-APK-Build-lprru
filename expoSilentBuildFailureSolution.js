The solution involves a multi-pronged approach.  First, increase the verbosity of the Expo CLI build command. Instead of `expo build:android`, try `expo build:android --verbose`. This will generate more detailed output, providing clues about where the build process is failing. Second, inspect the build log files.  These are often located in hidden directories, and their exact location can vary. Look for files containing the timestamp of the failed build.  Third, methodically comment out parts of your application code. Gradually re-introduce sections to pinpoint the code causing problems. Fourth, verify your Android development environment and Gradle configuration.  Ensure correct Android SDK setup, Java JDK installation and that Gradle is properly configured.  Fifth, and as a last resort, try creating a fresh project using `expo init` to rule out problems in your existing project's configuration.
