This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process may fail silently, without providing clear error messages in the terminal. This makes it difficult to diagnose and fix the underlying issue. The build may appear to hang indefinitely, or complete with a generic failure message such as "Build failed".  This can be especially frustrating because the log files generated by the Expo CLI during the build process might not contain enough information for effective debugging.
