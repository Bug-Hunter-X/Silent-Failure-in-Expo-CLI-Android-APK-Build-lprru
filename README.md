This repository demonstrates a common, yet elusive, bug encountered during Android APK builds using the Expo CLI. The issue involves silent build failures with limited or no diagnostic information in the console output.  The `expoSilentBuildFailure.js` file contains a simplified example that may trigger the bug. The solution file `expoSilentBuildFailureSolution.js` offers strategies to troubleshoot and resolve this problem.  Effective strategies involve carefully reviewing build logs (often located in hidden system directories), increasing the verbosity of the Expo CLI build command, and selectively commenting out parts of your application's code to isolate potential problematic areas.  Consider checking your Android environment setup and Gradle configurations as well. This repository aims to help developers quickly resolve this perplexing build failure.
